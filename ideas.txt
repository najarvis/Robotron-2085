Putting some ideas in here to keep track of

Is this a sequel to Robotron 2084 or a remake?

If remake, we still have a lot of work to do if we want to be faithful:
  - Really should only be able to fire and move in 8 directions
  - Missing Enemies:
    - Hulks - Kill humans and cannot be destroyed. Can be knocked back by shooting them.
    - Enforcers - Don't target the player directly, target area near them w/ random acceleration.
      - Spheroid (Enforcer generator)
    - Brains - Capture humans, convert them to "Progs", can also launch cruise missles at player.
    - Tanks - Fires projectiles that bounce around the screen
      - Quarks (Tank generator)
  - Level / Wave system
  - Lives system
  - Scoring system
  - Menu, possibly with exposition
  - Screen transition effects
  - Unique family members (though I don't think they have different behaviors)
  - The Arcade screen was only like 360x280 pixels. We could render to a smaller surface and then scale it to the full size
